***********

Performance improvements:
- reduce matrix multiplications?
- reduce texture fetches?

***********

next steps:
- double check p_phi in history tests
  also the weights are not multiplied
- support nested meshes (now it's only first-level, because we're not traversing the scene when overriding materials)
- support envmaps
?- proper refactor
?- always accepting lightsources hits?
?- proper objects thickness SSR checks?
?- how to support vertex-shader displaced vertices? atm you can only use matrices
?- glass objects
