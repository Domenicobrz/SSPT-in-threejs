1. cubePositionSetter seems like it has to be limited to a factor of * 10000 as its maximum distance
2. cubePositionSetter needs to make a mesh whose size is in the boundaries of the near/far plane (you can't make it e.g. 1 unit size, since the near plane is 1)
3. the radiance pass assumes that any position whose length is bigger than 9990 is in the "background" or in general outside of the scene
